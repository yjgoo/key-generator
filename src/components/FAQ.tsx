  {
    question: "Are the generated keys secure?",
    answer: "Yes, all keys are generated using cryptographically secure random number generators (CSPRNG). The entropy source is your browser's built-in crypto.getRandomValues() function, which is designed for cryptographic use."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you store or track generated keys?",
    answer: "No, we never store, log, or transmit any generated keys. All key generation happens locally in your browser, ensuring complete privacy and security."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between different key types?",
    answer: "Each key type is optimized for specific use cases: API keys for service authentication, JWT secrets for token signing, UUIDs for unique identification, passwords for user authentication, etc. Choose based on your specific requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use these keys in production?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Our generators use industry-standard cryptographic functions. However, always follow your organization's security policies and consider additional factors like key rotation and secure storage."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I choose the right key length?",
    answer: "Key length depends on your security requirements and the intended use. For most applications: 32-64 characters for general secrets, 256+ bits for cryptographic keys, and follow specific standards for JWT secrets or API keys."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this tool open source?",
    answer: "Yes, this tool is open source and available on GitHub. You can review the code, contribute improvements, or run your own instance for maximum security."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I generate multiple keys at once?",
    answer: "Currently, each generator creates one key at a time to ensure optimal performance and security. You can quickly generate multiple keys by clicking the generate button multiple times."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I refresh the page?",
    answer: "Generated keys are not saved and will be lost when you refresh the page. This is by design to ensure privacy. Always copy important keys before leaving the page."
